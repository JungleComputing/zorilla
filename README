***** Zorilla Distribution README *****

Zorilla is a P2P Supercomputing middleware. It tries to implement as much
features as possible common to most grid middleware systems (such as Globus and
Condor) but without any of the central components or management overhead. It
should be possible to set-up and run jobs on a zorilla network within 5 minutes.

For more information and publications on Zorilla see the website of the ibis
project: http://www.cs.vu.nl/ibis

***** Basic Zorilla System Overview *****

Zorilla nodes join together in a P2P network to cooperate in running 
supercomputing applications. So, to run applications on your own "p2p grid" 
you need to:

1) install a recent Java virtual machine (Java 1.6 recommended, though 1.5 may also work)

2) Start one or more Zorilla nodes and tell them about each other.
   Alternatively you can join an existing network. Use the zorilla or
   zorilla.bat script for this purpose (see below for more info)
   
3a) Submit nodes to your local node. Use zubmit or zubmit.bat

3b) Alternatively, use the JavaGAT

4) Done!


The Zorilla distribution consists of 4 sub parts:

1) node     The main Zorilla damon type application which is able to join a 
	    Zorilla P2P network, find resources, schedule jobs, etc.
2) zoni     An implementation of the Zorilla Node Interface used to contact
            a running zorilla node from a client. Used in the apps, the Zorilla
            GAT adaptor, etc.


***** RUNNING ZORILLA *****

there are several scripts in the "bin" directory to start and use Zorilla.

bin/zorilla     start a zorilla node
bin/zubmit      submit jobs to a zorilla node
bin/zee         print information on jobs and genral status of a node
bin/zet         set attributes of jobs and nodes
bin/zap         kill jobs and nodes

All these scripts need a ZORILLA_HOME environment variable set to the location
of your zorilla installation

use the --help option of each script to find out about the options. using no
options at all should suffice for most scripts though.

configuration options of zorilla can be set in multiple ways:

1) using the command line options of the "zorilla" script (see --help)
2) using system properties (usually set with the -Dvariable=key option of java)
3) using a configuration file (default location $HOME/.zorilla/config) consisting of
   lines with variable=key pairs

use the "--config_options" option for a list of valid options and a short
description for each.
